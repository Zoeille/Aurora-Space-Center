After 4 months of work, I am very proud to present my first add-on: Aurora Space Center!


Summary
-------


Aurora Space Center is a mod that adds IRL/fictives buildings and launchpads!
This mod has for vocation to be improved very strongly in the future, come back often to see the thread!

INSTALLATION & HOW TO USE IT
-------

Install Kerbal Konstructs and Module Manager (link below) and put Aurora Space Center into your GameData directory and that's all! 

To put a building: open the KK menu (ctrl+k) and place it anywhere you want ! 
(If you choose to place a launchpad, you will need to restart your KSP to convert it automatically into a launchpad)

Features:
- Buildings and launchpads use stock textures. All other textures (logo or text) can be modified in paint for exemple!
- Building and pads will automatically turn on and turn off spotlight like the real KSC buildings. 
- RSS compatible: all buildings are done in real scale ! (for stock users down the scale of buildings at building setup)

A huge thank you to @JadeOfMaar, @Omega and @CobaltWolf for their help, without them Aurora Space Center could not have looked like this.
And a very special thank to @Damon who helped me enormously when I started!
